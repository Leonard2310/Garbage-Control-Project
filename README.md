- TensorFlow (version 2.12.0 or higher)
- Keras-Applications (version 1.0.8 or higher)
- Keras-Preprocessing (version 1.1.2 or higher)

The majority of experiments were performed on the Colaboratory cloud platform for deep learning, specifically using a T4 GPU with 12.7GB of memory.

The script will evaluate the model using the test dataset and print the evaluation metrics.
